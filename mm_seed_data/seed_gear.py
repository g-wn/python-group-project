      "detailedDescription": "Not everyone wants or needs a large, offset game improvement iron. For those with better ball-striking skills but without the need for maximum shot-shaping versatility, TaylorMade has revamped their P·770 irons. They feature a smaller body, less offset, and a thinner top line than the P·790s, but still offer the forgiveness that comes with hollow-body construction. FLTD CG tungsten weighting moves the center of gravity gradually through the irons to optimize trajectory, and a mix of brushed and polished surfaces makes sure they look great even when they're not in play. They're joined in the lineup by new versions of the Tour-proven P·7MC and P·7MB models.",

Elvis Presley bought this 1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar in 1976, his second JetStar and third private jet, including the four-engine Convair 880, an early jet airliner that competed with the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. A fleet of jets were neccessary to transport Elvis and his crew across the country and the world on tours and travel. Elvis owned this JetStar for just over a year before selling it. The jet was owned by a Saudi company before being retired to Roswell International Air Center in Roswell, New Mexico, where it's been in storage for decades. The interior features overstuffed, crushed-velvet swivel seats, a microwave, tape deck stereo, and TV — although don't expect to fly away to Graceland. The four pod-mounted engines and flight instruments have been removed, and the overall condition could be described as poor. A time capsule of a bygone era, this JetStar will go up for auction at Mecum's 2023 Kissimmee event in January.",
