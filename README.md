## Project Information

<hr />
<br />

<p>
Reduncrate is a clone of Uncrate.com. It is a site which provides a feed-like experience for highly curated, boutique leaning items. Users can scroll the feed of curated items or filter by category. If a user has something more specific in mind, they can perform a search which will return matches from either the title or the description. A user can add any item to their cart for purchase, update the quantity or remove that item if desired. If a user is not ready to make a purchase right away, they can stash a product away to view later on their profile page. Also available on a user's profile page is a list of all items that they themselves have posted up for sale. From this list, as user can add a new items or edit an existing one. A user has the ability to edit any information they choose about their items, from price to image urls.
