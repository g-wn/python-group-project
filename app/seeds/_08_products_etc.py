The corn is raised in four varieties — red, blue, yellow, or calico — and hand-picked during the fall harvest after the sweet kernels have dried to perfection. Unlike the loose varieties, each ear is packaged with the popcorn kernels intact until you're ready to enjoy it. To prepare, place one entire whole cob into the included popping bag and then microwave into a satisfying snack that's just different enough from the regular popcorn experience to make movie night even better. We highly suggest having some real butter and salt handy after popping to enhance the flavor.",

The Porsche 959 is one of the Stuttgart-based firm's finest achievements, and it's celebrated in this set of three books. Penned by journalist Jürgen Lewandowski, each covers a separate topic.

Shingle and Stone examines the renowned architect's signature aesthetic and its evolution throughout his career. Featuring plans, renderings, and sketches, the book showcases 13 of Kligerman's projects, ranging from seaside dwelling on Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons to the rural retreats in the Pacific Northwest. It's written by the architect himself in collaboration with design editor Mitchell Owens and includes over 200 inspiring images.",
