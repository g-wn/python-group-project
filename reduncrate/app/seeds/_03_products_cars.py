      "detailed_description": "Canoo has taken its modular EV, the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, and outfitted for military service as the Light Tactical Vehicle. The US Army awarded Canoo a contract in July 2022 for a prototype, resulting in the LTV. Using the MPDV's 600-horsepower all-wheel-drive EV platform, the LTV uses carbon fiber and Kevlar materials to reduce weight and increase durability while loading up on tactical gear. The suspension uses air springs to raise ride height and fit 32-inch all-terrain tires for tackling harsh environments. The modular design allows for converting the LTV from flatbed truck to enclosed cargo vehicle, allowing for transporting or fitting a variety of tactical equipment. The LTV is will be entering production in early 2023.",

      "detailed_description": "Mercedes' flagship S-Class is now more powerful than ever with the AMG S 63 E.

That moves the massive sedan from 0-60 in just 3.2 seconds and on to a top speed of 180 MPH. Being a luxury sedan first, ride quality isn't compromised thanks to AMG's Ride Control+ active suspension and Active Ride Control stabilization technology with rear-wheel steering. An AMG-exclusive new grille, front fascia, and 21-inch AMG forged wheels differentiate the AMG S 63 E from the outside. The interior is luxurious as expected, with an AMG-specific steering wheel, interior coverings, and the latest MBUX infotainment system with Dolby Atmos sound system.",

      "description": "Based on the Series IIA, this Land Rover was built for service in the British armed forces.",
      "detailed_description": "The Royal Marines and British Army were in need of a military-grade 4x4 in the 1960s that could be carried by helicopter. The solution came in the form of the Land Rover Lightweight 88, based on the Series IIA. The Series IIA was re-engineered for easily removing non-essential items like the roof, doors, and windscreen when the truck was to be transported by helicopter. The truck was actually heavier than the standard Series IIA thanks to structural reinforcements required for military duty. Over 37,000 Lightweight 88s were built between 1968 and 1984. The Lightweight 88 Pictured here was built in 1972 and has been restored, with accessories like external lighting and a rooftop tent added.",

      "detailed_description": "Europe's best-kept secret in performance automobiles is the Czech Republic's Praga. The company has been racing for over 100 years, and now its bringing that experience to the road with the Bohema hypercar. Praga sourced the Nissan GT-R's twin-turbo V6 to power the clean-sheet carbon fiber monocoque chassis, with the UK's Litchfield stripping each motor and converting it to a dry sump system. The turbos are replaced and retuned to make 700 horsepower and 534 lb-ft of torque driving a Hewland six-speed sequential gearbox. A titanium exhaust is fitted along with F1 wind tunnel-tested carbon fiber bodywork to keep weight down to a svelte 2,204 pounds. 0-62 comes in 2.3 seconds, with a top speed of 186 MPH. Clever engineering keeps the car comfortable enough for road use without resorting to heavy active suspension components, and the interior was designed with more than just track days in mind. Production will start in 2023 with a goal of around 20 examples per year.",

      "detailed_description": "De Tomaso has introduced the P900, a track-only hypercar based on the 2019 P72 road car. Outside, the P900 is an evolution of the P72, with a redesigned front splitter, dive planes, and a massive rear wing with active elements throughout. De Tomaso has partnered with German engineering firm Capricorn for the heart of the P900, a naturally-aspirated V12. The unit will weigh just 485 pounds, with a 12,300 RPM redline and an estimated 888 horsepower. An Xtrac sequential gearbox will drive the rear wheels. Total weight for the P900 is expected to be just 1,984 pounds. Development of the V12 won't be complete until 2024, so customers wanting their P900 sooner will have the option of a V10 sourced from the 1997 Benetton B197 F1 car — no less aurally exciting, but output will be less at around 750 horsepower. 18 units will be produced, with customers having access to De Tomaso support engineers for track days.",
